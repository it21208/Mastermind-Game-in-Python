# Mastermind-Game-in-Python
Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game. The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern of the number, 
in both order and number - digit. 

Short Description: The player enters 4 or 5 or 6 numbers depending on the difficulty selected and the computer tells the player
how many (but not which) of the 4, 5 or 6 numbers are correct. High scores/names are stored in a file for each difficulty level 
of the game.

The only thing that needs to be changed by the user are the directory paths for the auxiliary files.
